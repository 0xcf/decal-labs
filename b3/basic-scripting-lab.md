# Scripting Lab Assignment

You'll be completing a classic first shell scripting assignment: make a 
phonebook.

Write a shell script `phonebook` which has the following behavior:

- `./phonebook new name number` adds an entry to the phonebook. and
- `./phonebook name` displays the name and phone number associated with that 
name.

- `./phonebook list` displays every entry in the phonebook (in no particular 
order). If the phonebook has no entries, display `phonebook is empty`

- `./phonebook remove name` deletes the entry associated with that name.

- `./phonebook clear` deletes the entire phonebook.

For example,

```
$ ./phonebook new Linus Torvalds 101-110-0111
$ ./phonebook Linus Torvalds
Linus Torvalds 101-110-1010
$ ./phonebook new Tux Penguin 555-666-7777
$ ./phonebook list
Linus Torvalds 101-110-1010
Tux Penguin 555-666-7777
$ ./phonebook remove Linus Torvalds
$ ./phonebook list
Tux Penguin 555-666-7777
$ ./phonebook clear
$ ./phonebook list
phonebook is empty
```

Here's the kicker: **You have to implement this same functionality in both 
`bash` and `python`.** This is to help illuminate the strengths and weaknesses 
of each language in the context of writing a simple CLI application.

Some tips to make things easier:

- `bash` has an append operator `>>` which, as you might guess, appends its 
second operand to the file passed in as the first operand.

  ```bash
  $ cat foobar.txt
  foobar
  $ echo "hello, reader" >> foobar.txt
  $ cat foobar.txt
  foobar
  hello, reader
  ```

- Remember that you can simply write to and read from a file to persist data
- Recall that `bash` exposes its command line arguments through the 
`$<integer>` positional parameters

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# contents of argscript.sh

echo "$1"
echo "$2"
```

```bash
$ ./argscript.sh foo bar
foo
bar
```

- In `bash`, single quotes `''` preserve the literal value of the characters 
they enclose. Double quotes `""` preserve the literal value of all characters 
except for `$`, backticks ``, and the backslash `\\`. The most important 
implication of this is that double quotes allow for variable interpolation, 
while single quotes do not. You can think of single quotes and the stronger 
"escape everything" syntax while double quotes are the more lax "escape most 
things" syntax.

```bash
$ echo `$LANG`
$LANG
$ echo "$LANG"
en_US.UTF-8
```

- In `python`, you can interact with command-line arguments through the 
`sys.argv` list ```python

  # !/usr/bin/python

  # contents of argscript.py

import sys print(sys.argv[1]) print(sys.argv[2])

````
```bash
$ ./argscript.py foo bar
foo
bar
````

- `python` lets you manipulate files with the `open` function, commonly used 
with the `with` control structure ```python

  # !/usr/bin/python

  # contents of fileman.py

with open('./newfile.txt', 'w') as f: f.write("hello from python\n")

````
```bash
$ python fileman.py
$ cat newfile.txt
hello from python
````

- [Here][14] you can see `python` used in a system administration context to 
implement the checkoff script used for this class
